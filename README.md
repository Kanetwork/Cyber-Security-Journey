### Investigative Professional | Transitioning to Blue Team Ops & DFIR

Welcome to my repository. I am applying my experience in evidence preservation to the world of Cybersecurity. I am currently **self-studying** to build a technical foundation in networking and digital forensics.

## 🧭 My Learning Path (In Progress)
I am currently working through a structured curriculum to bridge the gap from physical to digital investigation.

* **Current Focus:** [TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Hierarchy] 
* **Primary Objective:** Understanding how data moves across a network and where evidence is stored in an OS.

### 🛡️ Skills I am Building:
* **Network Analysis:** Learning to identify suspicious traffic patterns.
* **Scripting:** Using Python to automate repetitive investigative tasks.
* **Evidence Handling:** Applying the "Chain of Custody" mindset to digital artifacts.
