<u><strong>About This Repository</strong></u>

This repository documents my structured, hands‑on journey into cybersecurity, with a strong focus on Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). It serves as a growing collection of practical tools, scripts, notes, and experiments covering Python automation, threat detection, OSINT, malware analysis, networking, and core security fundamentals.

My goal is to build real, working solutions while developing the mindset and technical depth required to become a DFIR specialist. Each project reflects genuine progression — from foundational concepts to more advanced, investigative tooling — and is designed to demonstrate practical skills to future employers, support my certification path, and act as a reference for my future self.

Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow learner, or simply curious, this repository offers a transparent look at how I learn, build, break, and improve as I move deeper into the cybersecurity field.
