## <u><strong>About This Repository</strong></u>

This repository documents my structured, hands‑on journey into cybersecurity, with a strong focus on Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). It serves as a growing collection of practical tools, scripts, notes, and experiments covering Python automation, threat detection, OSINT, malware analysis, networking, and core security fundamentals.

My goal is to build real, working solutions while developing the mindset and technical depth required to become a DFIR specialist. Each project reflects genuine progression — from foundational concepts to more advanced, investigative tooling — and is designed to demonstrate practical skills to future employers, support my certification path, and act as a reference for my future self.

Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow learner, or simply curious, this repository offers a transparent look at how I learn, build, break, and improve as I move deeper into the cybersecurity field.

## <u><strong>Purpose and Vision</strong></u>

This repository is more than a collection of scripts — it’s a living record of my development as a cybersecurity practitioner. I’m building toward a career in DFIR, and this space captures the tools, techniques, and thought processes I’m developing along the way.

Every project here is intentionally practical. Instead of abstract exercises, I focus on creating tools that mirror real‑world workflows: evidence logging, automation, detection logic, OSINT gathering, malware analysis fundamentals, and network‑focused tasks. The aim is to show clear progression from beginner concepts to more advanced investigative capabilities.

This repo is built for three audiences:

Future me, who will look back on these foundations

Recruiters, who want to see real, demonstrable skill

Anyone curious, who wants to follow a transparent, structured learning path

My long‑term goal is to become a DFIR specialist, and this repository is the roadmap — documenting growth, supporting certification prep, and showcasing the practical skills I’m building along the way.
