## <u><strong>[Digital Evidence Log V1.0](./Python/DFIR_Evidence_Log)</strong></u>

**Project Overview:**
This project is a simple digital evidence logging tool designed to support basic DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response) workflows. It allows an investigator to record case details, generate a timestamped evidence entry, and automatically produce an MD5 hash to verify integrity.
The script demonstrates foundational skills in Python automation, file handling, and forensic record‑keeping.
